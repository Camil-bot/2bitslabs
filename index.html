          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p>
            In the fast-changing world of technology, the European Union
            regularly updates its compliance laws, posing a significant
            challenge for businesses to keep up. The information technology
            sector's rapid growth requires companies to constantly adjust their
            operations to align with the latest EU regulations. However, many
            businesses lack automated systems to efficiently monitor their
            compliance in real-time. This gap in automation can lead to risks
            and inefficiencies, as companies might depend on manual or outdated
            ways to check if they meet regulatory standards. To address this,
            it's crucial for businesses to implement advanced compliance
            monitoring platforms. These systems provide a proactive solution to
            ensure ongoing compliance with EU regulations, offering timely and
            accurate assessments essential for navigating the IT sector's
            regulatory landscape.

            >As our start-up is based on a compliance platform centered on the
            DSA act, a traditional approach might not have the desired result.
            As such, we went to a hackathon and a start-up conference in order
            to promote our solution and define the direction of our product. By
            talking to mentors and investors we were able to refine the idea,
            improve the solution, add features for the next iteration of the
            product and also promote us as a team and promote the idea of using
            LLM's in order to ameliorate problems for SME's and automate the
            auditing process for consultancy companies. Out of the 2, the
            start-up conference gave us the most exposure to potential clients
            and investors, whereas the hackathon helped us better define our
            technical solution, business model and user flows.
